# USE CASES AND FEATURES: 

This is a simple ecommerce application where users can log in, browse, and purchase book covers. 

Feature 1: Homepage. The user can browse the homepage, which includes links to the Gallery or a "Learn More" button that takes you to the contact info for the developers. 

Feature 2: Login and Admin. You can log in using your credentials and that makes the Admin page show up at the top of the nav bar. You can go to the Admin page to log out. 

Feature 3: The Gallery. This pulls in a list of book covers that display the book cover image, a title, and a description. The best book covers are pulled from the Open Library API, which is called by our backend for security reasons. 

Feature 4: You can purchase books and they will say "Bought" and those stay on your account during your session.
